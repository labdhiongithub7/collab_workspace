# Collaborative Workspace Application

A Flutter-based application for collaborative task management, enabling users to create workspaces, boards, and tasks with features like task assignment, status tracking, a Kanban board, and a simple Gantt chart for task timelines. Built with Firebase for backend and Firestore for database, leveraging Cubit and Bloc for state management.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and manage user profiles.
- **Workspaces**: Create and manage workspaces with multiple members or join workspace by workspace ID.
- **Boards**: Organize tasks within boards under workspaces.
- **Tasks**: Create tasks with title, description, status (To-Do, In Progress, Done), and optional due date.
- **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to workspace members and edit or add due date.
- **Kanban Board**: Drag tasks between status columns using `draggable and drag`.
- **Simple Gantt Chart**: Visualize task timelines based on creation and due dates.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Task changes sync instantly using Firestore streams.
